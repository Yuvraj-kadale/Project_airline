<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Air Malaysia group (AMG) is a luxury low-cost airline based in Malaysia. It is one of
Malaysia's fastest-growing airlines in terms of fleet size and destinations. The Air Malaysia
Group has scheduled flights to more than 100 locations in 25 countries. AMG decided to
improve their web booking by integrating their most recent flight offer, which includes airline
schedules, fare tariffs, passenger reservations, and ticket records.  

As a result, AMG asks us to design a Python programme for the ARS using suitable python
programming logic and principles, with the required features added in the programme
